# Introduction
Airbnb has revolutionized the travel industry by offering unique and affordable accommodations for travelers worldwide. With its popularity, there has been an explosion of Airbnb listings, making it difficult for both hosts and guests to determine the best price for their properties and stays. That's where exploratory data analysis (EDA) comes in. By analyzing a dataset consisting of data from [Airbnb listings in the state of Utah](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Utah--United-States/), we can uncover patterns and trends in pricing that can help hosts optimize their rental income and guests find the best deals on their next Airbnb stay. In this blog post, I will perform exploration on the dataset I previously scraped from the Airbnb website. Visit [my last blog post](https://sneslen.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/15/blog-three-a-repo.html) if you want to learn more about that process!
