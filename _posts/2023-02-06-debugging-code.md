Writing code is hard enough, but getting it to actually run? Sometimes it can feel like an insurmountable task. Working for hours on a script just for it to generate a supply of error messages is enough to wear down even the most hardened of programmers. Fortunately, there are a few methods and tricks that can help with identifying and preventing problems in your code.

# Prevention 
### 1. Walk through problem in your own words before you begin coding
### 2. Run small sections at a time
### 3. Write doc strings in functions
### 4. Comment and label your code
### 5. Keep things simple

# Solution
### 1. What do you expect vs what happened (rubber ducking)
### 2. Check for typos
### 3. Use debugging tools
### 4. Use print statements
### 5. Look up the problem/error message
### 6. Ask for help
### 7. Take a break
